# Project Proposal: SP18, Software Design Studio

## Cartoon Webcam 
For my final project, I want to take it all the way back to the old days of PhotoBooth. I fondly remember using PhotoBooth for all of its wacky filters and as a general means to waste time in middle school. Now, I want to create an open frameworks application that accesses your laptop's webcam and cartoonizes your face in real-time/. 

### How Can I Get Started?
